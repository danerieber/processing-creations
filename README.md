# processing-creations

When first introduced to Processing I thought it was for n00bs, but I learned the full extend of this powerful tool. From simulating matrix code to to having an epileptic siezure, processing can deliver a great source of fun to experienced coders. You can also write programs that make you look like you're writing programs! Check out the [XtremeHaxorz](XtremeHaxorz) project to see more.

## MatrixCode

The first processing creation, it simulates what the matrix code looks like from the movies.

## SuchRecursive

This one zooms in infinitely on a [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle) with a touch of doge.

## EpilepsySimulator

I was aksed to make a box bounce around the edges of the screen. I took it to the next level...
